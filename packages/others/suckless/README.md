## About Suckless
```
Suckless is a software development group that greatly focuses on FOSS software that follows the K.I.S.S format as well as the UNIX mentality - Do one thing only and that one thing well.

Generally, suckless applications are all-in-one programs that have the configuration files built-in to the source code.

This means that any changes made will either come in the form of patches, or directly to the source code itself 

for example,
    - dmenu
        - Edit 'config.def.h' to modify the configurations
            + 'config.def.h' will be compiled and built into 'config.h' which is then read into 'dmenu.c' and any other files that requires the configuration file
```
